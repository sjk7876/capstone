This capstone project presents a comprehensive computer vision system for analyzing volleyball serves. The work addresses the challenge of automatically tracking and analyzing volleyball ball trajectories during serve execution through a multi-stage pipeline combining video processing, frame extraction, and machine learning annotation. Key contributions include a systematic data collection methodology using standardized camera positioning, an interactive serve segmentation tool, and a comprehensive annotation framework for ball bounding boxes and court geometry. The system enables quantitative analysis of serve performance through automated ball tracking and trajectory analysis. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline for creating a structured volleyball serve dataset suitable for machine learning applications.
