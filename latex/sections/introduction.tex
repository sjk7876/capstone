\subsection{Motivation and Problem Statement}
This capstone project addresses the challenge of automated volleyball serve analysis using computer vision techniques \cite{IEEEexample:article_typical}. The motivation stems from the need for objective, quantitative analysis of volleyball serve performance, which traditionally relies on subjective coaching observations. Volleyball serves are critical to match outcomes, yet current analysis methods lack the precision and consistency needed for systematic performance evaluation.

\subsection{Goals and Scope}
The primary goal is to develop a comprehensive computer vision system for analyzing volleyball serves through automated ball tracking, trajectory analysis, and landing zone estimation. The scope encompasses data collection methodology, annotation frameworks, machine learning model development, and performance evaluation. The system targets serve analysis for training and coaching applications.

\subsection{Contributions}
This work contributes: (1) A systematic data collection methodology using standardized camera positioning, (2) Interactive serve segmentation tools for efficient video processing, (3) Comprehensive annotation framework for ball tracking and court geometry, (4) Machine learning models for ball detection and trajectory analysis, and (5) Open-source implementation of the analysis pipeline.

\subsection{Report Structure}
The remainder of this report is organized as follows: Section II provides background on volleyball serve mechanics and computer vision in sports, Section III presents the system overview and pipeline, Section IV describes dataset design and collection methodology, Section V details the annotation framework, Section VI covers model architecture and training, Section VII presents evaluation methodology, Section VIII shows results and visualization, Section IX discusses findings and applications, and Section X concludes with future work.
