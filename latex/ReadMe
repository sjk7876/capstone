The folling files are needed:
	IEEEabrv.bib
	IEEEtran.bst
	IEEEtran.cls
	IEEEtran_bst_HOWTO.pdf

This file you are reading now:
	ReadMe

This file has 2 targets 
	Makefile
		pdf:
			creates the pdf file
			you need to run it twice the first time, or after you modified *.bib
		clean:
			removes the generated files

Files you need to modify:
	example.bib - bibliography
	example.tex - the text
	background.tex
		will be inserted via \input{background.tex}.
		I am suggesting you use this over using one large tex file.

		change the term:
		\fancyhead[R]{\textit{RIT Computer Science ~\textbullet~ Capstone Report ~\textbullet~ 20171}}
		to the current term.
		add the content here
	example_longer.tex -  a longer example of example.tex

Files used in example:
	myfigure.pdf
	myfigure.png
